![jobsearch](https://github.com/svftbuns/fake-real-job-postings/assets/122664885/53592b60-ef27-4ce7-aafa-9156e33bd744)

## About 
Thought you secured a plum job? Well think again because it might be too good to be true. With the onslaught of fake job postings in the digital age, more people have fallen prey to these scams. As such we have identified the rise in fake job posting to be an increasing concern and decided to focus on this issue for our project. 

Using the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction">Real Fake Job Posting Dataset</a> on Kaggle, we have applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) to clean and analyse our text data. Thereafter, we trained multiple machine learning as well as deep learning models in order to evaluate the suitability of these models.
